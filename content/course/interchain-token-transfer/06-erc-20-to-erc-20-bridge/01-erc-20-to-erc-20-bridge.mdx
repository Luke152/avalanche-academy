## Transfer an ERC-20 Token &rarr; Avalanche L1 as an ERC-20 Token

This chapter will show you how to send an ERC-20 Token on C-Chain to an Avalanche L1 using Interchain Messaging and Foundry. This demo is conducted on a local network, but can be applied to Fuji Testnet and Avalanche Mainnet directly.

**All Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer contracts and interfaces implemented in this chapter implementation are maintained in the [`avalanche-interchain-token-transfer`](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/tree/main/contracts/src) repository.**

Deep dives on each template interface can be found [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/README.md).

_Disclaimer: The avalanche-interchain-token-transfer contracts used in this tutorial are under active development and are not yet intended for production deployments. Use at your own risk._

## Chapter Outline

1. Deploy an Avalanche L1 on local network
2. Deploy an ERC-20 Contract on C-Chain
3. Deploy the Interchain Token Transferer Contracts on C-Chain and Avalanche L1
4. Register Remote Token contract with the Home Transferer contract
5. Add Collateral and Start Sending Tokens

## Setup

<ICTTsetup />
From this output, take note of the following parameters

- Main funded account EWOQ (with 100 tokens),
- Interchain Messaging Registry on C-chain, and
- Interchain Messaging Registry on Avalanche L1

**IMPORTANT!** Set these parameters from the deployment output as environment variables so that we can manage them easily and use them in commands later.

```bash
export FUNDED_ADDRESS=<Funded Address (with 100 tokens)>
export TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_C_CHAIN=<Interchain Messaging Registry on C-chain>
export TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_L1=<Interchain Messaging Registry on Avalanche L1>
```
